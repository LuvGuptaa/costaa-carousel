Speaking of emails, his makeup requests are quite often reciprocated with NC threats (p.s. It’s not a threat anymore).

The weird part is, this wasn’t even the first time he was forced into submission by his best friend.  This was enough of a backstory to throw him into the loop of intoxication. The hindrance being his monthly allowance, Adarsh takes a proactive stance on cheap thrills, subsequently earning the title of “Thandai advocate”.
